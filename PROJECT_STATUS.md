## 🚧 Known Limitations

### OpenAPI Support
- ⚠️ OpenAPI 3.0.x supported, 3.1.x partially supported
- ⚠️ Some complex allOf/anyOf/oneOf schemas may not dereference perfectly
- ⚠️ Very deeply nested schemas (>3 levels) are truncated

### Performance
- ⚠️ Large specs (1000+ endpoints) may take several seconds
- ⚠️ No batch conversion support yet
- ⚠️ No progress indicator for long conversions

### Frontend
- ⚠️ No file preview before conversion
- ⚠️ No conversion history
- ⚠️ Single file upload only (no batch)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### High Priority
- [ ] OpenAPI 3.1 full support
- [ ] Progress indicator for conversions
- [ ] Batch file upload
- [ ] File preview before conversion
- [ ] Conversion history with localStorage
- [ ] Export to other formats (HTML, PDF)

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Custom formatting options
- [ ] API rate limiting
- [ ] User authentication (optional)
- [ ] Spec validation before conversion
- [ ] Interactive API explorer in output
- [ ] Custom template support

### Low Priority
- [ ] CLI tool (standalone)
- [ ] Browser extension
- [ ] VS Code extension
- [ ] Swagger 2.0 support
- [ ] GraphQL schema support
- [ ] API diff comparison

## 📊 Project Metrics

### Codebase
- **Backend**: ~540 lines (Python)
- **Frontend**: ~250 lines (TypeScript/React)
- **Documentation**: 2000+ lines (Markdown)
- **Examples**: 3 sample specs included

### Dependencies
- **Backend**: 3 core dependencies (FastAPI, uvicorn, PyYAML)
- **Frontend**: Modern Next.js stack with shadcn/ui

### Browser Support
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest)
- ✅ Mobile browsers

## 🐛 Bug Tracking

Current known bugs: **None** 🎉

To report bugs:
1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/yourusername/apiingest/issues)
2. Create new issue with details
3. Include example spec if applicable

## 🔐 Security

### Current Status
- ✅ CORS properly configured
- ✅ File type validation
- ✅ No persistent storage (files cleaned up)
- ✅ HTTPS ready (via deployment platform)
- ✅ Environment variables for secrets

### Security Considerations
- No authentication required (by design)
- Uploaded files are processed in-memory
- Temporary files are cleaned up immediately
- No user data stored
- No external API calls from backend

## 📈 Performance

### Benchmarks (Local)
- Small specs (1-10 endpoints): <100ms
- Medium specs (10-50 endpoints): 100-500ms
- Large specs (50-100 endpoints): 500-2000ms
- Very large specs (100+ endpoints): 2-10s

### Optimization Opportunities
- [ ] Caching for repeated conversions
- [ ] Parallel processing for large specs
- [ ] Streaming output for very large specs
- [ ] CDN for frontend assets
